This is the link for the webapp:-
https://logic-implementor--cs23b1008.replit.app/

I am running this on free deployment so my apis sometimes dont work, please excuse me for that but locally my api's are working fine if you all download my Logic Implementor folder from here 
and call the api's it will be working properly.

API ENDPOINTS AFTER DOWNLOADING THE FOLDER:- curl https://logic-implementor--cs23b1008.replit.app/health
curl -X POST https://logic-implementor--cs23b1008.replit.app/recommend \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"Java developer"}'
